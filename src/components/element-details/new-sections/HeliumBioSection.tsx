          <strong>No biological function:</strong> Helium is completely biologically inertâ€”does not interact or combine with other atoms in the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-toxic:</strong> It is non-toxic, non-irritating, and does not participate in any biological pathways.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inhalation risks:</strong> Brief inhalation changes voice pitch but prolonged inhalation can cause asphyxiation by displacing oxygen, leading to hypoxia or death.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medical uses:</strong> Heliox (helium-oxygen mixtures) used in medicine to treat respiratory conditions, as helium is less dense and reduces airway resistance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No nutritional role:</strong> Not an essential element for any plant, animal, or microorganism.
        </li>
