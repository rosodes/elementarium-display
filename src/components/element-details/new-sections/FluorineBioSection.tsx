        <strong>No essential role:</strong> Fluorine is not essential for human/animal metabolism.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Dental health:</strong> Low concentrations of fluoride help prevent tooth decay by strengthening enamel (hence addition to water or toothpaste).
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Toxicity:</strong> Excess fluoride causes dental fluorosis (tooth mottling/discoloration) and, at high levels, skeletal fluorosis (bone/joint issues).
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Biological impact:</strong> High concentrations are toxic to plants and animals. Chronic exposure is a health hazard.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Industrial risk:</strong> Inhalation or skin contact with hydrogen fluoride (HF) is extremely dangerousâ€”can cause deep tissue damage and systemic toxicity.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Environmental hazard:</strong> Fluorides released by industrial processes can accumulate in soils, water, and biota.
