        <li>Fluoride is not considered essential for human metabolism, but trace amounts protect tooth enamel from decay (caries).</li>

        <li>Acute fluorine gas exposure is extremely toxic, causing severe respiratory and systemic effects.</li>
        <li>Fluoride is toxic at high levels, especially to childrenâ€”regulations limit fluoride in water and toothpaste.</li>
        <li>Certain plants accumulate fluorine from soil and can be hazardous to grazing animals.</li>
        <li>Some pharmaceuticals contain organofluorine groups (e.g., certain antidepressants, anesthetics).</li>
